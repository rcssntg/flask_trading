# flask_trading
## PYTHON WEBAPP
This is a simple webapp for mock buy and selling item with client registration and authentication using flask.
Even following the tutorial of this project on **freecodecamp** youtube channel I face some bugs and issues due to some outdated
packages used in the original tutorial, so I need to google the answer to make it work, and thank God I made it to work!!!
This project uses **sql lite 3** for the database and bootstrap for styling the **HTML** so nothing fancy.

# Features
* Register and Login
* Buy and Sell items
* The price of the item will be deducted when you purchase the item and vice versa when you sell
* Modals targeting specific item when triggered.
